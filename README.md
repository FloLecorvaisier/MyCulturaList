## Lists

Lists work the following way: in the `lists.txt` file, you can add new lists and elements in those lists. The file should have two columns: in the first one, write the name of the list, and in the second one write the malID of the element you want in the list. There must be one element per row, and the malID must be correct else the app will crash. The column separator is a tabulation. Note that, at the time, adding too many items in the `lists.txt` file is not advised, as it makes the app unstable... I hope I will be able to fix it in a near future.
